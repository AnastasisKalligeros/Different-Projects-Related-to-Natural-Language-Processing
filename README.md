# Different-Projects-Related-to-Natural-Language-Processing

A project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Natural Language Processing". 

The application was implemented in python and as a development tool Visual Studio Code was chosen. Developing a Word Analyzer that reads a short story and can produce a list of sentences, each of which contains a list of words, developing a syntactic analyzer based on the syntactic analysis rules of the given Prolog model solution, generating the syntactic tree of the sentence. Development of a Semantic Analyzer based on the semantic analysis rules of the model solution in Prolog given by generating the semantics of the sentence (relations between verbs, nouns, adjectives, etc.). Program for information and questioning in a Knowledge Base that I have developed for this purpose. The questions and answers are given in natural language. </br> </br>
